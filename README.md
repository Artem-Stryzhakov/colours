# Project Title

This project was just practical for my skills.

The point of the project is that when you click on the **spacebar**, the project updates your colors in a random order. You can click on the lock to lock a color that will not be updated the next time the colors are updated.

---

When you click on the **hex color** code with the left mouse button, you copy this code and can later save it wherever you need.

# Choose color yourself

You can choose your own hex color code from other sources. When you pick them up, you can paste them into the url of the page where the hex codes of the current colors are located.

They are here:

artem-stryzhakov.github.io/colours/#**cfe1c8**-**c524b4**-**f5d133**-**2a7975**-**65f75d**

The bolded text is the hex code of the colors, you can insert your own colors in their place, but remember that the code must be inserted without the # symbol and with -.

*Example*: **cfe1c8-c524b4-f5d133-2a7975-65f75d**

*P.S. Before all colors there is this symbol **#**, DO NOT TOUCH IT, IT REFERS TO THE PAGE ITSELF, NOT TO THE COLORS.*
